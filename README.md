# Install-Printer_Artix-Linux

## Complete & step-by-step procedure
**Note:** All command "code" will be executed as Admin/"ROOT" apart `paru`-command, the AUR-Helper "Paru" (or another one you like) should be installed before you start with printer installation. When you are ready, open a terminal and become "ROOT"/Admin with [code]: `sudo -i`, insert your password when asked and be carefully **!** 

### 1.  Install prerequisite packages with: 
```
pacman -S --needed cups-openrc cups-pdf  cups print-manager system-config-printer
```

### 2. Detect service is installed, added with:
- Following [code] will show you the start-time, e.g. `default`

```
rc-update -v show | grep avahi-daemon

rc-update -v show | grep cupsd
```
### 3. Enable service-s with:
- In case one or both the services are not yet added>>

```
sudo rc-update add avahi-daemon default

sudo rc-update add cupsd default
```
- You can countercheck if successful with commands in **ยง 2.**

### 4. Check if "daemon-s" are already running (normally `avahi-daemon`) is it.
```
rc-status | grep avahi-daemon

rc-status | grep cupsd
```
- To see all service-s_status alphabetically sorted and in "verbose"-mode use:
```
rc-status --servicelist -s | sort -n
```
- To see all service-s not sorted but in "verbose"-mode btw. you can use the "search"-function of terminal after result with keys-combination [SHIFT + CTRL + F] and inserting the name of the service>>

```
rc-status --servicelist -s
```

### 5. If a "daemon" is not yet started, start service-s with: 
```
sudo rc-service avahi-daemon start

sudo rc-service cupsd start
```
- If all going well, recheck the status as in **ยง 4.** shown.

### 6. In case of errors by start of service-s, use following command-s:
```
rc-service --debug avahi-daemon start

rc-service --debug cupsd start
```
- Use the output of above two commands for asking support in the forum

- Check services `cupsd` and `avahi-daemon` are up and running as in **ยง 4.** shown **!**
### 7. Install Printer-Drivers (in case) from AUR with:
```
paru -S --needed brother-hl3152cdw
```
- In case you know only the manufacturer or model of your printer, use the search function of AUR-Helper (paru) as follow:

```
paru brother

paru hl3152cdw

paru hl3152
```

- Your printer-name or -model can be different **!** 

### 8. Configure printer-s over `systemsettings` or `http://localhost:631`
- System-Settings can be called different depending of your Desktop-Environment

Thanks for your friendness @[alium], you can post this next time someone (like me) ask again.
